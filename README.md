Android App Demo using NYTimes Most Popular API

The application uses The New York Times API.

In order to use the application, you need to request an API key from The New York Times Developer Network for Most Popular API. This can be done from the following url:
http://developer.nytimes.com/

The API KEY must be set in the config.xml resource file under the string "nytimes_api_key".

This application is unfinished, it still needs to appropriately acknowledge all of the used third party libraries and their licenses.
